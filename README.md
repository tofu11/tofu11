Hey there! I'm Ziang Chen, an aspiring software engineer currently studying at the University at Buffalo. Ever since I was a kid, I was drawn to the nerdy and geeky characters in moviesâ€”the ones who were always the tech wizards or hackers. To me, they were the coolest, and Iâ€™ve always wanted to be just like them. Now, I'm working towards becoming that tech-savvy person Iâ€™ve always looked up to, bringing a little bit of that movie magic into real life.
